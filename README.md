# Global-Weather-Web-App-React.js-Asp.net-Core-ApI
Global Weather Web App is used to check weather of any location/city by inputting the City name. I am Using AccuWeather API to display information about weather for any location. This application is build in React and Asp.net Core using Rest API.
ThIs is a single module for Global Tourism Web Application and will be combined with other modules to make a great integrated system.
